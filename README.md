# Feature-Engineering
> Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating features (also known as predictors or inputs) to improve the performance of a machine learning model. It is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, as the quality and relevance of features can significantly impact the accuracy of the model.
In essence, feature engineering involves identifying relevant information from raw data and transforming it into a set of features that can be used by the model. This can include creating new features by combining existing ones, selecting the most important features, and transforming features to better fit the assumptions of the model.
Feature engineering requires a deep understanding of the domain and the problem at hand, as well as a solid knowledge of statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. It can be both a creative and iterative process, as different feature sets may need to be tested and refined to achieve optimal performance.
The goal of feature engineering is to provide the model with the most relevant and informative features possible, allowing it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.Creating features

## Contents
1. Mutual Information
> Mutual Information is a statistical technique used to measure the degree of association between two random variables. In the context of feature engineering for machine learning, mutual information is used to quantify the dependency between a target variable and a feature. It measures how much information the feature provides about the target variable.
2. Creating features
> Creating new features is an essential aspect of feature engineering in machine learning. It involves transforming the existing raw data into new variables that can improve the performance of the machine learning models.
3. Interaction with categorical variables
> Categorical features are variables that take a limited number of possible values or categories, such as gender (male/female), color (red/blue/green), or nationality (American/British/French). These features can provide valuable information in a machine learning model, but they need to be preprocessed appropriately since most algorithms work with numerical data.
4. K-Means Clustering
> K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into a specified number of clusters. It is an iterative algorithm that aims to minimize the sum of the squared distances between the data points and their assigned cluster center.
5. Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in machine learning and data science. The aim of PCA is to reduce the number of features in the dataset while retaining the maximum amount of information. PCA works by identifying patterns in the data, and then creating new features that represent those patterns.
6. Target Encoding
> A target encoding is any kind of encoding that replaces a feature's categories with some number derived from the target.
